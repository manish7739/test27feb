    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Education In India</h2>
    <p>Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public
        education system, which fall under the command of the government
        at three levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles 
        of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and 
        Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is
        provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The 
        approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. 
        Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, 
        education policies and implementation were determined legally by
        each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the 
        constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'. From 
        this point on the central and state governments shared formal 
        responsibility for funding and administration of education. 
        In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight
        union territories, this means that the potential for variations 
        between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives 
        for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national policy 
        frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of 
        state-level programs and policies. State governments and local 
        government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary 
        schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. 
        Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies
        is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary education 
        (Grades 1-8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were
        under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools,
        schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in 
        alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately,
        one third are 'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment 
        in Grades 1-8 is shared between government and privately managed
        schools in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio 
        is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower</p>
